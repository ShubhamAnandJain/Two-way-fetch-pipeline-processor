# Two-way-fetch-pipeline-processor

This is the bonus project implementation for EE309 - Microprocessors course at IIT Bombay (2021 batch).

LM/SM instructions have not been implemented in this - this can be corrected by breaking LM/SM into many load/store instructions
at the Scheduler - however, you need to take care that the zero flag is not affected by this. 

The problem statement is attached in the repository.
